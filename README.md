# CS-210-Project-3-Corner-Grocer
 Corner Grocer


**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

   This project was aimed at creating a program that would log and catagorize produce items at a local grocer.  It was intended to provide data so that they may organize the produce section more efficiently.

**What did you do particularly well?

   My program successfully provided all of the desired functionality that was required.  

**Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

   I'm not sure about this one.  I would have to delve back into it and reexamine the project. 

**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

   The data handler was interesting.  I am fortunate to have a step son that works as a software engineer.  He has be very helpful in steering me in the right directions in this course. 

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

   I feel that I will be moving forward with a much better understanding of C++.

**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

   I just tried to follow industry standards in the design of the program.
